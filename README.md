mighty.standards serve as a repository of generic compute component
classes used to produce ADaM scripts in the {mighty} framework.

## Installation

You can install the development version of `mighty.standards` from
GitHub with:

``` r
pak::pak("NN-OpenSource/mighty.standards")
```

## Usage

`mighty.standards` provide generic classes to work with standard
components, and helper functions to retrieve them. For now it also holds
a small temporary library of components.

See `vignette("mighty-standards")` on how to work with standard
components.
